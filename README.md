# Set up
Before installing Django make sure you have installed python

run the command 

pip install django 

After installing its time to create django project setup By running the following command

django-admin startproject projectname

django will create some files  ex: urls.py,settings.py .......etc

open the project files

cd projectname

In order to run this a server is needed ,for django it will automatically give a light weight server so just run the following command to run the project

python manage.py runserver

After we run that we will see link with ip address that is local host address with a port number we can change port number

Use any editor like Visual studio code and open the folder which you have created you will see code in setting.py and in some other files also
